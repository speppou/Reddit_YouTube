# Reddit to YouTube

I enjoy watching YouTube on the TV. I also enjoy the curation of the masses on Reddit. Wouldn't it be great if there was some way to watch Reddit on your TV?

Luckily for me, I had some time a few years ago to throw together a script that does just that. First, it scrapes a given Reddit page (top for the day works well) for any YouTube links and then adds them to a YouTube playlist.

This requires access to the YouTube data API and I dont want to share my API key so if you would like to use it you will have to sign up to Goolge Cloud, create a project and get yourself API access. 

I currenly have this script running for two subreddits: [/r/videos](https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/top/?sort=top&t=day) and [/r/mealtimevideos](https://old.reddit.com/r/mealtimevideos/top/?sort=top&t=day). These are addied to two playlists on my channel: [/r/videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRg7KDv3GZUTX7kKaNhnmpPNBrIunNO64) and [/r/mealtimevideos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRg7KDv3GZUSSSBpvFIfUrNk-yQ_SMucK). These playlists will keep updating until either Reddit retires old Reddit, the authentication breaks, or my laptop dies.
